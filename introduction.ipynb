    "This approach involves setting up models or algorithms that allows the machine to learn from historical data. We train our historical dataset on the model and we fit the model on the dataset as best as possible then use this newly created model to predict the outcome of future events that it has never seen based on the patterns that it has learnt from the historical dataset\n",
